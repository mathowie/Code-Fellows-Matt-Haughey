Difference engine:

- A difference engine is an automatic mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions

not built, moved on to Analytical engine


Analytical engine:

- Charles Babbage's analytical engine (1830s) would have been the first Turing-complete machine if it had been built at the time it was designed. 

- wasn't built due to the British gov't pulling funding and issues with the lead engineer.

- Turning complete has conditional branching and the ability to store and change variables in memory
